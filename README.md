# The Construct
Adds a new character for Slay The Spire, complete with 50+ new cards.
More cards and relics coming soon!

The Construct is a mix of the many robotic enemies you'll find in the Spire, and uses familiar abilities like Mode Shift, supporting Orbs, and of course the Hyper Beam. Its main strength is adaptability; the new Cycle keyword gives you some control over the composition of your hand at any given time, and your starter Mode Shift cards allow you to switch between attack and defense on the fly.

This character is meant to feel as close to an official character as possible, with multiple potential deck archetypes and rewarding interactions between cards. Balance is an ongoing process and cards/relics may change over time.

## New Keyword: Cycle ##
**Definition:** When drawn, discard this and draw another card if the cycle condition is met. Only works once per card per turn.
**Examples:**
* Reactive Shield: Cycle if no enemy intends to attack. Gain 8 Block.
* Flak Barrage: Cycle if your Strength < 1. Deal 0 damage to a random enemy 5 times.
* Guard Orb: Cycle. When cycled, gain 2 Block.

## Installation ##
1. If you have `ModTheSpire` already installed you can skip to step 5. Otherwise continue with step 2:
2. Download `ModTheSpire.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)
3. Move `ModTheSpire.jar` into your **Slay The Spire** directory. This directory is likely to be found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire`. Place `ModTheSpire.jar` in that directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\ModTheSpire.jar`
4. Create a `mods` folder in your **Slay The Spire** directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods`
5. Download `BaseMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
6. Move `BaseMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
7. Download `ConstructMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/Moocowsgomoo/StS-ConstructMod/releases)
8. Move `ConstructMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
9. Your modded version of **Slay The Spire** can now be launched by double-clicking on `ModTheSpire.jar`
10. This will open a mod select menu where you need to make sure that both `BaseMod` and `ConstructMod` are checked before clicking **play**
